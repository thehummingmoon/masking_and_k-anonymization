# Alpha anonymous K-anonymity using non perturbative method
To compare efficiency of k-anonymization and it's variation Alpha anonymous K-anonymity.
A finance dataset has been K-anonymized and masked to protect data privacy. And Time Taken by each algorithm has been implemented. 
K-Anonymization can be applied only to quasi-identifiers. So, from the dataset, the columns- "Segment","Country", "Month Number","Year" has been utilized to show utility and privacy.
Later, non perturbative method called global recoding is used for implementing alpha anonymous k-anonymity, to provide privacy and utility comparing to the older traditional k-anonymization method.
